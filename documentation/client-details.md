# Client Communication

This document describes the process to securely enrol a client into the management system.

## Security
Clients communicate over a TCP socket!

Installation script is embedded with server's public key so that client and server can perform key-exchange securely. 

[ecies](https://ecies.org/) will be used to encrypt data between client and server. This library has a version for both go and javascript, so will be standardised between client and server.

Each communication will be signed with the client or servers public token using ECDSA. The signed data shall simply contain the client's ID. This will ensure the client and server are authenticated and data integrity is maintained.

Packet structure as follows:
1. OP Code (1 byte)
2. Sender Public Key (65 bytes)
3. AES Nonce (16 bytes)
4. AES Tag (16 bytes)
5. Encrypted data (Max 438 bytes - calculated from max TCP datagram size specified in [RFC 879](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc879#section-1))

## Servers
Maintain two HTTP servers:
 - One server for the web dashboard - exposed over plain HTTP (Designed to be proxied!)
 - One server for client communication - HTTPS only! Uses a self-signed certificate to communicate with clients


## Client Enrolment

### 1. Generate Token
To enrol a client, a 16 digit token will be generated by the administrator from the dashboard. This serves a number of purposes:
 - Ensures clients can only join with permission from an administrator - they cannot be added without the token.
 - Identifies clients against specific labels/tags
 - Limiting how many clients can be enrolled or expiring the enrolment token

The token is generated using `crypto.randomBytes(8).toString("hex")`

### 2. Command Line Generated
The dashboard generates a script file that can be run on clients.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Verify script is running as root
if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]
  then echo "Please run as root"
  exit
fi

now=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H_%M_%S)

filename="/tmp/client_linux_$now.sh"
public_key="0f6a960103b08b03e79174277685162c7fbf089619c106fb62a533339dc22af2"
server_address="server.address"

# Download script from server
wget https://$server_address/clients/linux -o $filename --pinnedpubkey "sha256//$public_key"

# Make the script executable
chmod +x $filename

# -> Installation of thing here <-
```

### 3. Client Enrols with server

1. Attempts to connect to server using address.
2. Attempts to verify token against server.
3. Attempts to establish secure relationship with server.
   - d
4. **Only** after all of the above successful, then the client will install onto the client.
